## Project Description

In this analysis, we perform the following tasks:

1. **Data Loading**: We load the dataset from a CSV file and inspect its contents using Python libraries like Pandas.

2. **Data Analysis**: We analyze various aspects of the data, including:
   - Calculating the average age of individuals.
   - Conducting geographical analysis to identify the most common region.
   - Comparing insurance charges between smokers and non-smokers.
   - Calculating the average age of individuals who have at least one child.

3. **Data Visualization**: We visualize some of our analysis findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful plots and charts.

4. **Modeling (Optional)**: We use a simple linear regression model to make predictions about which features are most influential for an individual's medical insurance charges.

5. **Bias Analysis (Optional)**: We explore areas where the data may include bias and how that could impact potential use cases.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `insurance.csv` and includes information on age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges for individuals.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `insurance.csv`: The dataset file.
- `US-Medical-Insurance-Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code and analysis.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Daylinn/US-Medical-Insurance-Analysis.git


2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `US-Medical-Insurance-Analysis.ipynb` to explore the code and analysis steps interactively.

3. Run the code cells sequentially in the notebook to reproduce the analysis and visualize the results.

4. Customize and extend the analysis as needed for your purposes.
